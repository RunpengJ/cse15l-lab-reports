## Remotely Connecting
---
1. Find your course specific username by clicking the *[link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)*

2. (optional) *[Reset your password](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php)* as you need. The initial password to your course specific account is the same one to your SSO account by defalut.
    - Use your <strong>course specific username and select "no" </strong>if you don't want your password to your SSO account to change.

3. Open a command line window and type the commands below **Substitude your account name for "cs15lfa22".**
    ```
    bensonjian@benson-mac ~ % ssh cs15lfa22@ieng6.ucsd.edu // Type your account
    
    The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.238)' can't be established.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? Yes // Type yes
    
    (cs15lfa22@ieng6.ucsd.edu) Password:  // Type in your password. It won't show up anything, just hit "enter" whenever you finish
    ```
    
    It means you sucessfully connect to the remote server if you see the message in the picture below, which is a not perfect example: ðŸ‘‡
